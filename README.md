# Middleman
(This project is currently discontinued.) Middleman is a system I created with the initial goal of better understanding how to handle live streams of data from platforms, exclusively for my own personal curiosity. As the title suggests, what the scripts provided are supposed to emulate is a sort of man in the middle communication, where one live stream is captured and restreamed over a different session through a RTMP link; it relies on the creation of a local media server with packages such as node media server and the use of FFMPEG to convert the stream from WebRTC to RTMP (which can then be used on applications such as OBS to be restreamed). The example in this repository is based on the Web version of Snapchat, the Tampermonkey script has the purpose of capturing the stream from a call and sending it over the node server, where it's then converted; obviously, it's just an example, it can be applied to ANY other platforms where you can theoretically capture live stream data.
